* reshape2
* zoo
```{r}
#install.packages("XML")

#install.packages("plyr")
#install.packages("reshape2")
#install.packages("zoo")

library(XML)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(reshape2)
library(zoo)
```

##Acquiring stock market data
In this section the data is downloaded from the finviz.com website. However, since the stock data is already provided it will not be downloaded.
```{r}
#build download url.
#url_to_open <- sprintf("http://finviz.com/export.ashx?v=152&c=%s", paste(0:68, collapse = ","))

#download csv file
#finviz <- read.csv(url(url_to_open))

#load the csv file
finviz <- read.csv("data/finviz.csv")
```
